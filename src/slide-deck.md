# **AI, Graphic Design, and You**

An introduction to AI-enabled graphic design.

![bg right:50% 100%](./assets/about-me.png)

# Introduction

<hr/>

I'm a **software engineer** and **cinematographer**.

I've done the **graphic design** for my wife's piano albums.

I've helped with the **graphic design** for our son's upcoming children's book series.

# Foundation

While AI tools may dazzle with novelty, the heart of graphic design remains the same: **clear, purposeful communication**.

# Mindset

---

# Iterative

<hr/>

**Start with Curiosity, Not Perfection**: Generative AI tools are playgrounds for creativity.

**Fail Fast, Learn Fast**: AI lets you test multiple design directions quickly, reducing the time and risk associated with traditional concepting.

**Sketch More, Commit Less**: AI is a rapid sketchpad—generate broad variations without over-investing, and refine the most promising results.

# Collaboration

### Workflows

<hr/>

**Many Ideas, Human Refinement**: Use AI to rapidly generate diverse visual concepts, then step in to refine and finalize the strongest direction.

**Focused Prompting, Iterative Editing**: Collaborate with AI across multiple passes—adjust prompts and tweak outputs progressively to shape a single, polished result.

**One-Shot Simplicity**: For low-stakes, a single AI-generated image might be “good enough,” saving time without sacrificing clarity.

# Human in the Loop

Transitioning from AI to final edits: adding a human touch.

---

**AI Gets You 80% There—You Bring the Last 20%**

Use generative outputs as a strong starting point, then apply your design instincts to polish details, align with brand, and add human nuance.

**Recognize When “Good Enough” Isn’t Enough**

While AI can produce impressive results, final edits ensure precision in typography, composition, and visual storytelling that AI often overlooks.

**Treat AI as a Drafting Assistant, Not the Author**

Take control once the core idea is clear—your hands-on refinement turns rough inspiration into intentional, high-quality design.

<small>"Hands should be palm-to-palm."</small>

# Going Multimodal

Multimodal AI tools process and generate both text and images, bridging visual and verbal creativity.

---

## Looking for a starting point?

Multimodal models like **GPT-4o** can analyze existing images too!

---

## Ask the AI!

Instead of guessing what to write, use multimodal AI to co-create prompts.

Start with a reference image, ask the model to describe it, then tweak that description to guide new outputs in a similar style or tone.

# Conclusion

<hr/>

This presentation was created with a lot of help from **AI**.

- The outline was developed iteratively using **ChatGPT's voice mode** on my iPhone.
- The images were generated with **ChatGPT 4o**'s multimodal capabilities.
