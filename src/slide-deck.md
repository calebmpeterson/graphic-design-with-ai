# **Graphic Design, AI, and You**

An introduction to AI-enabled graphic design.

#### About Me

<hr/>

I'm a **software engineer** and **cinematographer**.

I've done the **graphic design** for many of my wife's piano albums.

I've helped with the **graphic design** for our son's upcoming children's book series.

# Foundation

While AI tools may dazzle with novelty, the heart of graphic design remains the same: **clear, purposeful communication**.

**Having an understanding of the fundamental concepts of graphic design gives you an advantage.**

# Mindset

## Iterative

<hr/>

**Start with Curiosity, Not Perfection**: Generative AI tools are playgrounds for creativity.

**Fail Fast, Learn Fast**: AI lets you test multiple design directions quickly, reducing the time and risk associated with traditional concepting.

**Sketch More, Commit Less**: AI is a rapid sketchpad—generate broad variations without over-investing, and refine the most promising results.

### Many Ideas, Human Refinement

Use AI to rapidly generate diverse visual concepts, then step in to refine and finalize the strongest direction.

---

### Focused Prompting, Iterative Editing

Collaborate with AI across multiple passes—adjust prompts and tweak outputs progressively to shape a single, polished result.

### One-Shot Simplicity

For low-stakes, a single AI-generated image might be “good enough,” saving time without sacrificing clarity.

## Human in the Loop

Transitioning from AI to final edits: adding a human touch.

### AI Gets You 80% There—You Bring the Last 20%

Use generative outputs as a strong starting point, then apply your design instincts to polish details, align with brand, and add human nuance.

### Recognize When “Good Enough” Isn’t Enough

While AI can produce impressive results, final edits ensure precision in typography, composition, and visual storytelling that AI often overlooks.

### Treat AI as a Drafting Assistant, Not the Author

Take control once the core idea is clear—your hands-on refinement turns rough inspiration into intentional, high-quality design.

<small>"Hands should be palm-to-palm."</small>

## Going Multimodal

Multimodal AI tools process and generate both text and images, bridging visual and verbal creativity.

---

### Looking for a starting point?

Multimodal models like **GPT-4o** can analyze existing images too!

---

### Ask the AI!

Instead of guessing what to write, use multimodal AI to co-create prompts.

Start with a reference image, ask the model to describe it, then tweak that description to guide new outputs in a similar style or tone.

# Conclusion

<hr/>

This presentation was created with a lot of help from **AI**.

- The outline was developed iteratively using **ChatGPT's voice mode** on my iPhone.
- The messaging was heavily refined using **ChatGPT**
- The images were generated with **ChatGPT 4o**'s multimodal capabilities.
